- **MAP 6356**	`Partial Diff Equations`

  -  This course starts with a gentle introduction to the `theory of distributions` and `Fourier transform` and proceed to use it to prove the existence of fundamental solutions for partial differential operators with constant coefficients. This course will also move on to the rudiments of `Sobolev spaces` and `the boundary value problems for elliptic ,  hyperbolic and parabolic equations`. This course will also discuss the connections to `integral equations` and `Fredholm theory` in the context of `classical potential theory`.

- **MAA 6506**	`Functional Analysis I`
  - This course will cover following contents:
      1.  Elementary properties of Topological Vector Spaces,
      2.  Basic properties of `Banach` and `Hilbert spaces`,
      3.  Basic properties of linear operators on Banach and Hilbert spaces,
      4.  Compact opeartors,
      5.  The `Riesz Representation Theorem`,
      6.  The `Hahn-Banach Theorem` and its consequences,
      7.  The `Uniform Boundedness Principle`,
      8.  The Open Mapping and the `Closed Graph Theorem`,
      9.  Basic properties of the Adjoint of a linear operator on a Banach space,
      10.  The basic properties of Duality in Banach spaces.
