# Biography
Hi, Guys, Welcome! My name is Fudong Wang, obviously from the name, I am a Chinese. From Zhejiang of China to Tampa of Florida, I am pursing the Ph.D degree constraining on **Applied Mathematics** at [University of South Florida](http://www.usf.edu). Hopefully, I will graduate at 2019. Supervised by [Dr.Ma](http://shell.cas.usf.edu/~wma3/), I will continue my research mainly focus on **soliton solutions of nonlinear partial differential equations**. Recently, our group which is leaded by [Dr.Ma](http://shell.cas.usf.edu/~wma3/) is studying applying Riemann-Hilbert Problem to represent soliton solutions and furthermore obtain the long time asymptotic behavior of solutions provided some special initial and boundary conditions.

As for this site, I will write everything that I would like to share to the whole world, including mathematics, movies, music etc.
