# Biography
Who am I? Fudong Wang, Male, not yet Ph.D of Mathematics, potential programmer(a joke?!). Alright, seriously, honestly, I am a 3rd year PhD student at [Department of Mathematics and Statistics](http://math.usf.edu), [USF](http://www.usf.edu). My research is about `soliton solution` of **nonlinear partial differential equations**, including `integrable system theory`, `inverse scattering transform`, `Riemann-Hilbert Problem` and `asymptotic analysis`. Besides, I like traveling (what? who doesn't), playing all kinds balls(table tennis, tennis, etc), watching movies and TV shows (I am a big fan of Game of Thrones), and listening Hip-Hop(J.Cole, Jazz-Rap).
