title: About Me
author: Fudong Wang

I am Fudong Wang, the owner of the blog. I am current a PhD student (2/3 candidacy) at Department of Mathematics and Statistics, University of South Florida. I am interested on **integrable system, solitons, hamiltonian system, partial differential equations, Riemann-Hilbert Problem, inverse scattering transform**. Recently, (and I am quite sure it will last a long time), I am studying inverse scattering transform and its application in solving nonlinear partial differential equations. Besides, coding is my hobby. Perhaps that's why I use **Hugo** to write personal blog. And I am a big fan of **Game of Thrones**, and I'll end this self introduce by the famous quote from game of thrones:
